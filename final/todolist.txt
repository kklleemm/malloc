malloc step:
       -search in zones the first who can accept a ptr with size_t size:
               -if nothing zone, create it
       -create new struct, place size, and is_free = 0
       -ptr - 1 = &struct
       -zone.size -= size
       -return ptr

free step:
       -if (ptr - 1)->is_free == 1 then double free
       -(ptr - 1)->is_free = 1
